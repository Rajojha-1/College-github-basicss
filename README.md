# College-github-basics
INTRODUCTION-
Learning GitHub for college projects.
Github helps college students to analyse and manage their programs efficiently with version control, it helps in building team projects easier by cummulating all the data in one place and also by showing the changes made.
-My goals with GitHub
My goal with GitHub is to make good programs and make repositories of them for helping people out and also to enhance my skills by forking others programs and analysing it.
I would first make sure that i know the basics of GitHub as soon as possioble then I would start using it thoroughly, and make myself comfortable of using it.
